# PrideFlagGenerator
Generates gradients of 11 different pride flags with Python and a lot of math. Happy pride month!

Note: generating all 11 takes over a minute @ 1080p; I wouldn't recommend going above that resolution and honestly 720p or 480p is probably fine.
Also, you'll need the Python library [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html) to generate these yourself.
